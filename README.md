IT Operation: Root Cause Analysis

* Our Data Center team wants to build a model to predict causes of issues reported by customers.
* We use a system monitoring tool to track CPU, memory, and application latency for all of our services.

NOTE: We also track specific types of errors reported by our applications. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

  Using data about CPU load, memory load, and netwrok delays along with the three types of errors, build a model to predict the root cause of errors.

  Data set is available in the repository for each incident, indicating if any load issues or errors was observed during that time.
